## Technical Implementation Details

### Key Features Implemented:
1. **Scroll Direction Detection**: Real-time tracking of up/down scroll direction
2. **Velocity-Based Animations**: Header responds faster to quick scrolls
3. **Smooth Slide Animation**: Header slides completely out of view when scrolling down
4. **Quick Reveal**: Header comes back instantly when scrolling up
5. **Opacity Fade**: Elements fade gracefully during transitions
6. **Background Blur**: Adds depth and polish to the header
7. **Spring Animations**: Natural, responsive feel matching iOS design language

### Animation Parameters:
- Header slide sensitivity: 0.5x for down, 1.2x for up
- Velocity multipliers: 2.0x max for down, 3.0x max for up
- Spring response: 0.4s with 80% damping
- Interpolating spring: 300 stiffness, 30 damping

### Following Design System:
- Uses DeepRed design tokens for colors and spacing
- Maintains 8pt grid system
- Follows SwiftUI best practices
- Implements proper accessibility considerations
