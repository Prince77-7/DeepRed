### ✅ Fixed Home Feed Card Scaling for Perfect Scrolling Experience
- **Task**: Fixed card scaling issue where wrong cards were becoming larger during scroll
- **Problem**: Complex area calculations were unreliable and stopped working, especially when scrolling up
- **Solution**: Simplified to track which card center is closest to actual screen center
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Added `cardPositions` state to track each card's center Y position in global coordinates
  - Created `updateCardPosition()` to capture card center using GeometryReader with global frame
  - Added `scrollViewBounds` tracking for actual scroll view position in global coordinates
  - Built `updateCurrentIndexBasedOnScreenCenter()` to find card closest to screen center
  - Calculates distance from each card center to actual screen center Y position
  - Only considers cards within visible scroll view bounds (prevents off-screen interference)
  - Simple distance comparison - closest card to screen center wins
  - Improved animation timing (0.4 response, 0.85 damping) for smoother transitions
  - Reliable behavior regardless of scroll direction (up/down)
- **Result**: 
  - Card closest to screen center now properly scales up
  - Works consistently when scrolling up and down
  - No more interference or logic breaking after brief working periods
  - Native, beautiful scrolling experience that feels seamless and responsive
  - Professional iOS-quality feed behavior matching TikTok/Instagram
  - Smooth spring animations for all card transitions

- **Problem**: Comments sheet was covering the entire screen, unlike YouTube/TikTok behavior
- **Solution**: Implemented presentation detents for partial screen coverage
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Added `.presentationDetents([.medium, .large])` to comments sheet
  - Medium detent covers approximately 2/3 of screen (default)
  - Large detent allows users to expand to full screen if needed
  - Added `.presentationDragIndicator(.visible)` for intuitive interaction
  - Removed duplicate drag indicator from sheet content
- **Result**: 
  - Comments sheet now opens to 2/3 screen coverage like YouTube/TikTok
  - Users can still expand to full screen by dragging up
  - More native iOS behavior with partial sheet presentation
  - Video content remains partially visible behind comments
  - Professional user experience matching modern social media apps
- **Status**: Complete

### ✅ Fixed Header Animation to Slide Smoothly to Screen Edge
- **Task**: Fixed header animation with proper shadow overlay that remains for visual separation

- **Solution**: Implemented offset-based animation with shadow overlay that stays visible when content fades
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Removed `max(0, headerHeight + headerOffset)` frame height constraint
  - Changed to fixed `.frame(height: headerHeight)` to maintain consistent header size
  - Added `.offset(y: headerOffset)` to actually move the header position
  - Synchronized opacity and offset thresholds (both use 60pt)
  - Added easeInOut curve (`progress * progress * (3.0 - 2.0 * progress)`) for smooth transitions
  - Changed to spring animations (`.spring(response: 0.3, dampingFraction: 0.8)`) for natural feel
  - Created layered background system:
    - Base shadow overlay (black gradient) that always stays visible
    - White overlay on top that fades out with content
    - Both layers extend to top edge with `ignoresSafeArea`
  - Applied opacity only to content (logo, buttons), not background
  - Kept `.clipped()` to ensure header is cut off at screen edge
- **Result**: 
  - Header content slides smoothly and fades when scrolling down
  - Header content slides smoothly back when scrolling up (symmetric animation)
  - Subtle shadow overlay remains visible for visual separation and status bar protection
  - Shadow extends all the way to top edge of screen (no harsh edges)
  - Smooth transition from solid white header to shadow overlay
  - No more abrupt appearing/disappearing in either direction
  - Professional, native iOS scrolling behavior with spring physics
  - Matches behavior of premium social media apps like Instagram/TikTok with proper overlay
- **Status**: Complete

### ✅ Added Dreamy Glassmorphism Top Shadow Overlay
- **Task**: Added beautiful glossy shadow overlay that appears when scrolling down
- **Problem**: Needed premium visual separation and dreamy effect at top of screen during scroll
- **Solution**: Implemented multi-layered glassmorphism overlay with smooth animations
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Created `scrollProgress` computed property with smooth easing curve
  - Built layered overlay system:
    - Base `.ultraThinMaterial` blur for glassmorphism effect
    - Dreamy gradient overlay (white to black to clear) for depth
    - Glossy highlight at top for premium shine effect
  - Height of 140pt for proper visual coverage
  - Opacity scales with scroll progress (0 to 1) using smooth curve
  - Added `.animation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.2))` for fluid transitions
  - Extended to screen edges with `ignoresSafeArea`
- **Result**: 
  - Beautiful dreamy, glossy shadow appears when scrolling down
  - Reflects content behind with ultra-thin material blur
  - Smooth gradient from top (white highlight) to bottom (transparent)
  - Premium iOS aesthetic matching high-end design apps
  - Fluid animation that scales with scroll position
  - Creates sophisticated visual depth and separation
- **Status**: Complete

### ✅ Redesigned Search to Expandable Header Bar
- **Task**: Replaced search sheet with inline expandable search bar in header
- **Problem**: Search sheet was disruptive and didn't follow design.md principles of fluid, purposeful animations
- **Solution**: Created smooth horizontal expansion animation that transforms search button into full search bar
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Added `isSearchExpanded` and `searchText` state variables
  - Added `@FocusState` for automatic keyboard focus management
  - Created conditional layout: collapsed (logo + buttons) vs expanded (search bar + cancel)
  - Implemented smooth spring animations (0.4 response, 0.8 damping) for all transitions
  - Added proper transition modifiers for seamless element animations
  - Auto-focus TextField with 0.2s delay after animation starts
  - Proper focus dismissal when canceling

- **Status**: Complete

### ✅ Fixed Camera Preview Double Tap Gesture for Camera Switching
- **Task**: Fixed double tap gesture conflict and camera session management issues in CameraRecordingView
- **Problem**: Multiple issues were preventing camera switching:
  - Gesture conflict between single tap (focus) and double tap (camera switch)
  - Camera session being recreated on each switch causing preview layer disconnection
  - Audio session errors during camera switching
- **Solution**: 
  - **Gesture Handling**: Replaced conflicting .onTapGesture modifiers with state-based tap counting system

  - Users can now double tap the camera preview to switch between front and back cameras
  - Camera preview stays connected during switching (no black screen)
  - No more audio session errors during camera switching
  - Camera switching works during recording for creative video transitions
  - Single tap still works for focus feedback
- **Status**: Complete

### ✅ Fixed Camera Dismiss Logout Issue
- **Task**: Fixed camera X button causing logout instead of just dismissing camera overlay
- **Problem**: CameraRecordingView was using `@Environment(\.dismiss)` which dismissed wrong view context
- **Solution**: Changed to use `onDismiss()` closure for proper overlay dismissal
- **Changes Made**:
  - X button now calls `onDismiss()` instead of `dismiss()`
  - Video post completion now calls `onDismiss()` instead of `dismiss()`
  - Removed unused `@Environment(\.dismiss)` property
- **Files Updated**:
  - Views/Recording/CameraRecordingView.swift (dismiss handling)
- **Result**: 
  - Camera overlay dismisses properly without affecting authentication state
  - No more accidental logout when pressing X button
  - Proper overlay dismissal maintaining user session
- **Status**: Complete

### ✅ Wrapped iOS 26 Tab Bar Code with Custom Tab Bar Implementation
- **Task**: Adapted iOS 26 TabView code to work with existing custom tab bar, removing version dependency
