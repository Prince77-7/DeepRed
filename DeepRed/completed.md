- **Problem**: Keyboard would remain open when users tapped outside text fields, creating poor UX
- **Solution**: Implemented reusable view modifiers for keyboard dismissal
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Created two view modifiers in DesignSystem.swift:
    - `.dismissKeyboardOnTap()` - Simple tap gesture for any view
    - `.dismissKeyboardOnBackgroundTap()` - Background overlay that doesn't interfere with child interactions
  - Uses native iOS `UIApplication.shared.sendAction(#selector(UIResponder.resignFirstResponder))` 
  - Applied background tap version to main container views to avoid interaction conflicts
- **Files Updated**:
  - DesignSystem.swift (view modifier extensions)
  - Views/Services/ServicesMarketplaceHub.swift (search functionality)
  - Views/Services/GigApplicationView.swift (proposal TextEditor)
  - Views/Services/PostGigFlow.swift (multi-step form inputs)
  - Views/Services/ProjectManagement.swift (message input)
  - Views/Feed/HomeFeedView.swift (SearchView)
  - Views/Authentication/EmailLoginView.swift (login form)
  - Views/Authentication/EmailSignUpView.swift (signup forms)
  - Views/Recording/VideoPostView.swift (caption input)
- **Result**: 
  - Native iOS keyboard behavior throughout entire app
  - Professional, polished user experience matching system apps
  - Users can tap anywhere to dismiss keyboard naturally
  - No interference with existing button or gesture interactions
  - Consistent behavior across all text input scenarios
- **Status**: Complete
